# exercise 3.3.2 from unit 3

'''
Astronaut defined a string in a variable called msg (the string is a word from the field of astronomy). Unfortunately for the astronaut, the value of the msg variable was deleted for him.
Your task: try to deduce, through the outputs of the commands in front of you, what the string in the msg variable is:

Please note, the solution to the exercise does not require running the commands themselves (running will throw an error because the msg string is unknown)
Put the string you discovered into the text box (without quotes).
'''

#>>> len(msg) 
# 6
# >>> msg[-1::]
# 'y'
# >>> msg[::2]
# 'szg'
# >>> msg[1] == msg[3] == msg[5]
# True
